<p>This is Disney's animation of a classic tale. The beautiful princess, Rapunzel, has been locked away in a tower since she was captured as a baby by an old hag. Her magical long blonde hair has the power to provide eternal youth, and the evil Gothel uses this power to keep her young. At the age of 18, Rapunzel becomes curious about the outside world, and when a prince uses her tower as a refuge, she asks him to help her escape. </p>

<h3>Rapunzel's & My Similarites</h3>
<p>My Bachelorâ€™s degree in Political Science from the University of Central Florida has provided me knowledge in government principles and practices. Additionally, my coursework created a strong foundation in research/analysis, and influenced my professional writing skills. I am grateful to have continued my education at the University of Florida and pursue a Master's Degree in Mass Communications with an emphasis in Political Communications.</p>
<p>Throughout the course of my career, I have created extensive relationships in the Florida Senate, House, Judicial and Executive Branches. I hope to continue building life-long connections and strong ties throughout the entire state of Florida.</p>
