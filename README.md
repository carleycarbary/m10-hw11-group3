Stumbling Blocks:

I encountered some stumbling blocks. I attempted to add Modals to the home page but when viewing them in LiveServer they would not work. Instead I created links to individual pages the other group members made using the movie poster as the clickable. I also encountered some issues with the grid area names not working. Im not sure I fixed it, but made the page do what I intended in some other way.

No challenges.

My biggest challenge was adding the animation and transition to my page. It took a few tries but I got a result I was happy with.
