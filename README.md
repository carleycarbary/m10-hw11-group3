Stumbling Blocks:

I encountered some stumbling blocks. I attempted to add Modals to the home page but when viewing them in LiveServer they would not work. Instead I created links to individual pages the other group members made using the movie poster as the clickable. I also encountered some issues with the grid area names not working. Im not sure I fixed it, but made the page do what I intended in some other way.

No challenges.

My biggest challenge was adding the animation and transition to my page. It took a few tries but I got a result I was happy with.

For this assignment, my main stumbling blocks were figuring out how to fork the pull repository and sending a pull request.
However, I was able to figure out the answer to these problems through the help of groupmates and online videos.

In terms of the setup of the page, I did not encounter many stumbling blocks. 

My main issues were figuring out the best way to 
add animation/transformations. 

It also took me a long time to figure out how to add the background image to fill up the whole page. However, I realized that it was an error on my part. So, I was able 
to resolve this. It was hard to read the font after adding this, so I decided to just use white. 
 
In addition to the background image, I also spent time figuring out which images to add to the website. I tried out a few options, but ultimately went with ones that represented the text as well.
