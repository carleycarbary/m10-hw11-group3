        <p>As a beautiful young woman of pure heart, Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) has an idyllic life in a forest kingdom. When an invading army threatens the land, Maleficent rises up to become its fiercest protector. However, a terrible betrayal hardens her heart and twists her into a creature bent on revenge. She engages in an epic battle with the invading king's successor, then curses his newborn daughter, Aurora -- realizing only later that the child holds the key to peace in the kingdom.
        </p> 
        <p>I identify with Maleficent for a variety of reasons. Chief among them is that she is different. Because she is different she is treated differently, not to start but as time wears on. Her heart is hardened. It takes an act of true love to change her mind.</p>
        <p>This movie is followed up by Maleficent: Mistress of Evil</p>
